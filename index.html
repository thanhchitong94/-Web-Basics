		<h2><strong>101 Things About Myself</strong></h2>
		<p>As you've already known, I'm very famous. I used to love being in the limelight and seeing my name
			<mark>highlighted</mark> in the newspaper.</p>
		<p>But lately, I've been feeling a little bit tired because of my popularity. I just want to move to an
			uninhabited island and enjoy myself. Thanks to the Corona Virus, I can <sub>hide my self</sub> from the
			paparazzi for a while and do everything I want to.</p>

			<h2>

				<i>Many people think that we can't be friends but it's not the truth. We can all be famous at the same time.</i>
			</ul>
